# Basics
Questions to keep in mind
1. different architecture pieces that can be used
2. how do these pieces work with each other?
3. how can we best utilize these pieces, what are the tradeoffs?

# Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems
* Scalability
* Reliability
* Availability
* Efficiency
* Manageability

## Scalability
capability of a system, process, or a network to grow and manage increased demand

*Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling*
* Vertical - adding more power to the existing server, limited to the capacity of a single server, may involve downtime. E.g. mysql
* Horizontal - adding more servers, easier to scale e.g. Cassandra, MongoDB

## Reliability
The probability that a system will fail in a given period.
